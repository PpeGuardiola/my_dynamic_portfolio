            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I’m an 18-year-old Cybersecurity student at Caleb University, passionate about technology, digital safety, and the future of secure systems. I'm currently in my 100 level and building a solid foundation in areas like ethical hacking, network security, and data protection.

                When I’m not deep in studies or exploring new cyber tools, I love managing and playing Call of Duty: Mobile. I’ve been part of several competitive scenes, even taking on leadership roles with some of the top teams in Africa. I enjoy strategy, teamwork, and pushing my limits both in games and in real life.
                
                Outside the screen, I’m curious, always learning, and focused on growth. Whether it's coding, gaming, or solving real-world security problems, I’m driven by the challenge.
                
                Looking to connect, collaborate, and keep evolving.
                
                I enjoy learning new technologies and bringing ideas to life through code. My focus is on building user-friendly and responsive web applications.</p>
